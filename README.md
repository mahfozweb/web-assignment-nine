# What is React Router?

React Route is a library that helps you build single-page applications (SPAs) in React — where your app doesn’t reload when you navigate between pages.

Instead of loading a new HTML page from the server every time, React Router dynamically updates the UI based on the URL — all inside your single React app.

## What is firebase?

Firebase is a Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) platform made by Google.
It helps developers quickly build web and mobile apps — without writing a lot of backend code.

So instead of creating your own server, database, and authentication system, Firebase gives you all of that ready to use.

## Firebase How to work?

- Create a Firebase Project
- Add my App (React Project)
- Install Firebase in my Project
- Import & Use in React
